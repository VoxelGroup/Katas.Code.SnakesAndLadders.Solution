# The exercice
This is a kata solution (https://github.com/VoxelGroup/Katas.Code.SnakesAndLadders), we want to have a technical discussion about this solution with you.

You should read the description of the kata, then review the code and prepare the points that you think could be improved. You can answer questions like:
What do you think we should improve in the code?
What do you think the repository is missing something?
Do you think the code correctly implements the features?

During the interview you will change some part of the code, with some new feature or fixing some point of improvement.
